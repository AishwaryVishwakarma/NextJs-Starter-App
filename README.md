# Next.js Starter App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To set up your Next.js starter app using `degit`, follow these steps:

### 1. Install `degit`

`degit` is a straightforward project scaffolding tool that allows you to clone repositories without their Git history.

Install `degit` globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g degit
```

### 2. Initialize the Project

Use `degit` to clone the starter template into your project directory:

```bash
npx degit https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-starter-app your-project-name
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `your-project-name` with your desired project name.
